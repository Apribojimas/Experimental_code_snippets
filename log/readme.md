# Candidates for review
* [Plog](https://github.com/SergiusTheBest/plog) - Portable, simple and extensible C++ logging library. Contains most of functionality, but header only :(
* [BLogger](https://github.com/d-tatianin/BLogger) - An easy to use modern C++14/17 async cross-platform logger which supports custom formatting/patterns, colored output, Unicode, file logging, log rotation & more! Project dead?
